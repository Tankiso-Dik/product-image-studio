# Theme Resources

Visual style is driven by soft gradients, subtle noise, and floating orbs reminiscent of productivity dashboards.

## Assets
- **SVG Packs**: Place grunge overlays and decorative shapes under `public/assets/`.
- **Fonts**: The project uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) as the primary typeface.
- **Tailwind Tokens**: Color and spacing tokens live in `tailwind.config.js`. Extend this file when adding new themes.

## Guidelines
- Keep backgrounds light with radial gradients.
- Apply a lowâ€‘opacity noise texture for depth.
- Use Tailwind utility classes first; fall back to CSS when necessary.
